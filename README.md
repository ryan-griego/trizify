# TRIZify


Using OpenAI's LLM, TRIZify will use the TRIZ principles to help you systematically solve complex problems, innovate efficiently, and overcome contradictions. This application is built using Next.js, and connects to the OpenAI API.

## Key Features

- **Direct API Access**: By using your own OpenAI API key, you can interact with ChatGPT directly. This means your requests go straight to OpenAI, without any middlemen.

- **Privacy**: One of the benefits of using the API directly is that OpenAI does not track the messages you send. This is great for privacy-conscious users who want to ensure their data remains confidential.

- **Customizable Prompts**: With specific prompts, you can guide the language model to respond in the way you want. This allows for a more personalized and controlled chat experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with TRIZify, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have these, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
