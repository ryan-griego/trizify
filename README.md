Chat RRG is a application that allows users to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT directly using their own OpenAI API key. This application is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, and connects to the OpenAI API to provide a seamless chat experience.

## Key Features

- **Direct API Access**: By using your own OpenAI API key, you can interact with ChatGPT directly. This means your requests go straight to OpenAI, without any middlemen.

- **Privacy**: One of the benefits of using the API directly is that OpenAI does not track the messages you send. This is great for privacy-conscious users who want to ensure their data remains confidential.

- **Customizable Prompts**: With specific prompts, you can guide the language model to respond in the way you want. This allows for a more personalized and controlled chat experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Chat RRG, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have these, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the application.
